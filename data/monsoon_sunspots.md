Rao (1976) documented a relationship between sunspot activity and seasonal rainfall over India:  
“Jagannathan and Bhalme (1973) have brought out evidence that the seasonal rainfall depends upon sunspot activity. The rainfall is larger during sunspot maximum than during 
sunspot minimum over North Assam, North Bengal, Bihar and sub–Himalayan East Uttar Pradesh and the central parts of the Peninsula”.
Indian summer monsoon rainfall distribution patterns also vary with sunspot cycles and result from the development of anomalous circulation features:
During a sunspot maximum, negative pressure anomalies (monsoon trough) are displaced farther northward to the foot of the Himalayan mountain region- 
a condition typically associated with monsoon breaks. 
During a sunspot minimum, the core of negative pressure anomalies is displaced farther southward over Orissa-Madhya Pradesh-Rajasthan- 
a condition typically associated with active monsoon conditions.
