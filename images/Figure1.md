Sunspots appear as dark spots on the surface of the Sun. Temperatures in the dark centers of sunspots drop to about 3700 K (compared to 5700 K for the surrounding photosphere). 
Faculae are bright areas most easily seen near the limb of the solar disk. During a sunspot cycle, the faculae outnumber sunspots and make the Sun appear slightly brighter at sunspot 
maximum that at sunspot minimum.
