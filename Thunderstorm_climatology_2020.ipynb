    "### Overview: December 2019 was confirmed as the starting point of the new solar activity cycle, in which sunspot activity was observed to be at an 11-year minimum. Through the winter and spring of 2020, sunspot number gradually increased with corresponding significant severe thunderstorm outbreaks occurring in the continental United States (CONUS) during February and April 2020.\n",

    "### Abstract:\n",
    "The reference date and amplitudes of the minima and maxima of the 11-year solar cycle are established based on the sunspot number maintained and distributed by the SILSO World Datacenter since 1981 at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Sunspots are dark areas that become apparent at the Sun's photosphere due to intense upward-forced magnetic flux from further within the solar interior. Heating areas along the magnetic flux in the upper photosphere and chromosphere become visible as faculae, causing cooler (7000 F), less dense, and darker areas at the core of these magnetic fields than in the surrounding photosphere (10,000 F). The resulting visible phenomenon is thus seen as sunspots. Active regions associated with sunspot groups are usually visible as bright enhancements in the corona at EUV and X-ray wavelengths.  Clette et al. (2014) provide a historical review and perspective of the development and evolution of sunspot number calculation techniques, most notably the International Sunspot Number.  Recent studies of the potential impact of sunspot activity on global weather and climate patterns have identified relationships between sunspot number and, collectively, south Asian Monsoon rainfall patterns (Rao 1976) and thunderstorm activity over central Europe (Schlegel et al. 2001).  Schlegel et al. (2001), based on a comparison of monthly-averaged sunspot number and lightning stroke frequency, inferred a significant functional relationship between sunspot number and thunderstorm activity over central Europe (R > 0.53, see Figure 2 below). However, this study only focused on warm-season (i.e., April to September) thunderstorm occurrence. Thunderstorm outbreaks during the cold season of the year (i.e., the months of November through March/April) typically occur in environments with low amounts of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and solar heating of the earth's surface. Cold-season severe thunderstorms are often generated by the release of potential instability by large-scale forcing. Thus, another enhancing factor for cold-season severe thunderstorms should be explored to describe storm outbreaks on a regional scale. The period from January to April 2020 exhibited several thunderstorm episodes that increased in magnitude with the new solar cycle's commencement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction: \n",
    "Thunderstorm wind reports over CONUS are obtained via WxData API (https://wxdata.com/api-storm-reports-explorer), and corresponding daily sunspot number values are obtained from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) website (http://sidc.be/silso/datafiles). Since lightning is relatively rare during the cold season, measurements of severe wind (i.e., wind > 40 miles per hour (mph)) associated with convective storms is selected as a proxy variable of thunderstorm occurrence. The total number of wind reports is calculated for each semi-monthly period between November 2019 and April 2020 and compared to the sum of daily sunspot number values for each semi-monthly period. Linear regression is selected as the most appropriate model in which to derive a functional relationship. For the study period (November 2019 - April 2020), coefficient of determination, correlation coefficient, and explained variance are calculated for a dataset of 12 storm wind report and sunspot number totals to assess model performance. Thus, this study expands upon Schlegel et al. (2001) by analyzing sunspot and thunderstorm totals on a semi-monthly time scale during the cold season of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions:\n",
    "1. What is the relationship between sunspot number and cold-season severe thunderstorm frequency?\n",
    "2. How can this relationship be quantified, modeled, and assessed?\n"

    "## Discussion/Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thunderstorm wind reports over CONUS were obtained via WxData API (https://wxdata.com/api-storm-reports-explorer), and corresponding daily sunspot number values were obtained from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) website (http://sidc.be/silso/datafiles). The total number of wind reports was calculated for each semi-monthly period between November 2019 and April 2020 and compared to the sum of daily sunspot number values for each semi-monthly period. For the study period (November 2019 - April 2020), regression metrics were calculated for a dataset of 12 storm wind report and sunspot number totals. The correlation coefficient of 0.6 between the thunderstorm wind report and sunspot number total for each semi-monthly period is consistent with the results of Schlegel et al. (2001) that documented correlation coefficients of 0.53 and 0.65 between monthly lightning stroke (delta) number and sunspot number (R) over an entire solar cycle (1992-2000). Also, explained variance values of 0.39 to 0.41 show that sunspot activity could function as one of at least three crucial forcing factors for cold season thunderstorms, in addition to atmospheric instability and weather patterns.\n",
    "In summary, this study entailed a short-term analysis of thunderstorm reports and sunspot number measurements, binned into semi-monthly segments over the first six months of solar cycle 25 and during the cold season. The correlation of 0.6 for both semi-monthly total and mean sunspot numbers demonstrates a significant functional relationship between sunspot and cold-season thunderstorm activity over CONUS that can serve as a starting point for more detailed studies of the relationship between solar cycles and the intensity of regional convective storm activity."

    "## Limitations/Future Work:\n",
    "An outlier in this dataset is the low storm wind report total for January 16-31 2020, marked by a red \"X\" in the scatterplots. Although the sunspot number for this period was relatively high, the low number of wind events, recorded over offshore ocean waters, suggested that the majority of severe thunderstorm activity occurred over subtropical open ocean waters where weather observations are sparse relative to land areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to derive a more robust functional relationship between sunspot number and thunderstorm activity over CONUS, this procedure will be conducted for cold seasons over an entire solar cycle (i.e., 11-year period)."
